    My Top 3 Movies of all-time
 </h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Brave Hart</h3>
 <p>Best movie ever. <br> 
   Honestly, this movie hits deep. It’s all about standing up for what you believe in, no matter the odds. Plus, the battles and the whole vibe of fighting for freedom just get you really invested in the story.</p>
 <h3>Titanic</h3>
 <p>Best love movie. <br> 
   I remember watching Titanic and just getting completely caught up in the love story. It's a mix of romance and real-life tragedy, and the whole thing just sticks with you, especially with how epic the ship scenes are.
 </p>
 <h3>Hangover</h3>
 <p>Best comedy. <br>
   If you need a laugh, The Hangover is a no-brainer. It’s one of those movies where things just keep getting crazier, and you can’t help but laugh at how ridiculous everything gets. Definitely a go-to for a fun night!
